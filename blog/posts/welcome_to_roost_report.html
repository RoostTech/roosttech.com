		<b>Welcome to Roost Report</b><br/>
		Roost Report is the new home for the Roost Technology
		blog. Here we will be posting articles about urban
		homesteading, product updates, and related DIY products. Like
		all things made for a utilitarian purpose, this space is under
		constant improvement. The next big feature to add is some kind
		of comment system. Here at Roost Technology, we think that
		while homesteading is all about self-reliance, there is a
		substantial benefit in having a community to interact with and
		glean information from while providing some knowledge
		yourself.<br/>
		As always, if you have any questions or comments, please do
		not hesitate
		to <a href="mailto:info@roosttechnology.com">Contact us</a>.
		<br/>
		Happy Homesteading!
