		<b>Tech in Homesteading</b><br/>
		Homesteading is more than having a vegetable garden or a
		handful of chickens. Homesteading is a lifestyle. The choice
		to live a self-sufficient lifestyle is the first step to
		becoming a homestead. Whether your homestead is one hundred
		acres or one hundred square feet, by the fact that you have
		deigned it "your homestead" you have made a choice to be more
		self-reliant than the average person.<br/><br/>
		Maybe you homestead for an economic reason, maybe you
		homestead for a philosophical reason; Whatever your reason,
		there are many commonalities between all homesteads whatever
		their size, location, or purpose.<br/><br/>
		<b>All homesteads strive to create a significant portion of their
		foodstuffs themselves.</b><br/>Being able to eat of your own hands is
		the basis for all other self-sufficient acts. Not being
		beholden to another for your sustenance allows the economic
		freedom that exists.<br/><br/>
		<b>All homesteads practice the free exchange of ideas.</b><br/>Have you
		ever asked another homesteader for any kind of advice? Be it
		how to grow better beans or how to make your own linen, they
		never once required that you agree to not sharing the
		information yourself as a condition of you receiving it.<br/><br/>
		<b>All homesteads participate in an unrestricted free
		market.</b><br/>While there are government regulations on some
		selling of homestead produced goods, most homesteads operate
		on a barter system with other homesteads. This is the
		definition of a free market in which one participant freely
		exchanges the fruit of their labor for the fruit of another's
		labor.<br/><br/>
		By virtue of these common characteristics, homesteads also
		fit into the ideals of free software. Free software is
		software that allows users to run the software for any
		purpose, change the program in any way, distribute copies of
		the original software, and distribute copies of the software
		that contains your changes. This is just like how homesteads
		act; One homesteader transfers some implement or knowledge
		unto another who then does whatever they wish with it. The
		receiving homesteader can modify the good or augment the
		knowledge and then transfer it to another homesteader in
		kind.<br/><br/>
		The inclusion of software in homesteading may seem out of
		place; But software is just a tool to be used however the
		craftsman decides. And if using the tool of software,
		especially free software, can help make your homestead more
		self-sufficient then that tool belongs in your shop.<br/>
		Technology is not the answer to every issue, nor is forgoing
		technology the answer. The best approach to technology is a
		measured approach - Deciding if the benefit that a given
		technology brings is worth the downsides that the technology
		brings. For example, having a web-based knowledge repository
		of gardening information is great. Such a repository gives
		people information that they may have not had access to
		previously. However, this same technology has the side effect
		of a user no longer needing to ask their neighbors for
		gardening advice.<br/><br/>
		Technology has its role as a tool in any person's
		toolshed. That tool however is a double-edged sword;
		Technology can help people and divide people from their
		community at the same time. Just as you wouldn't use a hoe to
		dig a hole, you shouldn't use technology to solve problems
		that it isn't meant for.
